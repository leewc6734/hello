# Project Name: BOM parser
The BOM parser is a tool to parsing and calculates how many the specific components needs in target BOM table. To remove or combine the duplicate components in the BOM list. It's a very simple but useful tool for someone who need do this shit every day. XDDDD

The first version that development in Python language, I try to re-write with C# and have a better GUI, that's the target!
